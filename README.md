# Laravel API Vue Forge – Frontend Base

This project is the **frontend base** for the **Laravel API Vue Forge** generator.  
It uses the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev) to provide a modern, responsive, and scalable user interface.

This repository is intended to be used as the foundation for automatically generated frontend applications that consume APIs generated by **Laravel API Vue Forge**.

## Clone frontend repository
To use the frontend generator, we need the base project so that the generation occurs in the correct locations.

```bash
php artisan apiforge:setup-front
```
The Vue 3 + Quasar project will be cloned to the directory specified in the configuration.

## Frontend Generation

To generate a frontend scaffold for a specific model in your Laravel project, run the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan apiforge:front-quasar {ModelName} --fromTable --table={table_name}
```

### Example

```bash
php artisan apiforge:front-quasar Post --fromTable --table=posts
```

This command will generate the frontend structure and components based on the given model and database table.

## Installation and Usage (Development)

If you are developing or customizing this frontend base, follow the steps below.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the application in development mode  
(Hot reload, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
npm run dev
# or
quasar dev
```

### Build the application for production

```bash
npm run build
# or
quasar build
```

## Laravel Integration

Make sure your Laravel project is configured to serve this frontend as a Single Page Application (SPA).

You can run the following command:

```bash
php artisan apiforge:setup-spa
```

This will configure the Laravel routes to properly serve the SPA frontend.
